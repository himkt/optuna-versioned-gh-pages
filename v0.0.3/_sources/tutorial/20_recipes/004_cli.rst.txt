Command-Line Interface
======================

.. csv-table::
   :header: Command, Description
   :widths: 20, 40

    create-study, Create a new study.
    delete-study, Delete a specified study.
    dashboard, Launch web dashboard (beta).
    storage upgrade, Upgrade the schema of a storage.
    studies, Show a list of studies.
    study optimize, Start optimization of a study.
    study set-user-attr, Set a user attribute to a study.

Optuna provides command-line interface as shown in the above table.

Let us assume you are not in IPython shell and writing Python script files instead.
It is totally fine to write scripts like the following:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-39

.. code-block:: default



    import optuna


    def objective(trial):
        x = trial.suggest_float("x", -10, 10)
        return (x - 2) ** 2


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        study = optuna.create_study()
        study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)
        print("Best value: {} (params: {})\n".format(study.best_value, study.best_params))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    Best value: 0.00012525389244451423 (params: {'x': 1.9888083114569555})





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-42

However, we can reduce boilerplate codes by using our ``optuna`` command.
Let us assume that ``foo.py`` contains only the following code.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-49

.. code-block:: default



    def objective(trial):
        x = trial.suggest_float("x", -10, 10)
        return (x - 2) ** 2









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-70

Even so, we can invoke the optimization as follows.
(Don't care about ``--storage sqlite:///example.db`` for now, which is described in :ref:`rdb`.)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat foo.py
    def objective(trial):
        x = trial.suggest_float('x', -10, 10)
        return (x - 2) ** 2

    $ STUDY_NAME=`optuna create-study --storage sqlite:///example.db`
    $ optuna study optimize foo.py objective --n-trials=100 --storage sqlite:///example.db --study-name $STUDY_NAME
    [I 2018-05-09 10:40:25,196] Finished a trial resulted in value: 54.353767789264026. Current best value is 54.353767789264026 with parameters: {'x': -5.372500782588228}.
    [I 2018-05-09 10:40:25,197] Finished a trial resulted in value: 15.784266965526376. Current best value is 15.784266965526376 with parameters: {'x': 5.972941852774387}.
    ...
    [I 2018-05-09 10:40:26,204] Finished a trial resulted in value: 14.704254135013741. Current best value is 2.280758099793617e-06 with parameters: {'x': 1.9984897821018828}.

Please note that ``foo.py`` only contains the definition of the objective function.
By giving the script file name and the method name of objective function to
``optuna study optimize`` command, we can invoke the optimization.
